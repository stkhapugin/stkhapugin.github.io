title: Make Apps, Not Holywar
---

I am tired of Swift fanboys that are begging for holywars by comparing Objective-C with Swift. Just look at this gem:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;All Objective-C is technical debt&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/dantoml">@dantoml</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftSummit">@SwiftSummit</a> <a href="http://t.co/G6lnjk3wHE">pic.twitter.com/G6lnjk3wHE</a></p>&mdash; Radek Pietruszewski (@radexp) <a href="https://twitter.com/radexp/status/579591661342343168">March 22, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Since obviously none of the two languages is superior in all imaginable metrics at once (*at least Objective-C language name is better in terms of character length and worse in terms of character shortness*), these "Swift > ObjC" statements are very close-minded. Dear fellow devs, please be more constructive and logical in your criticism — after all, logic and constructiveness are cornerstones of our profession.

I mean honestly, there are tons of ways to compare the two in a scientific way: performance, LOCs, feature sets, and much more. Not to mention all sorts of real life scenario comparisons like code readability and safety. Two examples of where Objective-C excels that come to my mind are extensibility (*all Apple Mail plugins are written by method swizzling*) and tool quality (*I'm looking at you, SourceKit*). 

Please don't holywar. You just look silly.
